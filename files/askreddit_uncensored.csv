There was this similar themed show in Hongkong and Mainland China years ago
"  They swapped billionare with bottom feeders, let the rich do the basical job, on the lowest salary, to see how far the rich could go by purely their own effort"
"   Nearly all of the billionare admitted that they could not make anywhere, regardless of how hard they worked, even working without sleeping and resting could not give you any accumulation to help climb up to the higher level of the society"
"  There was only despair, and admission that the divide between the poor and the rich is already a deep valley and mere personal effort makes little sense"
"  It stirred big debate among the society back then, and I think that was part of the reaons the show got cancelled "
"  There was also another show in China, swapping senior political figures with community level council workers, to see how good they could do in each other's posts"

It’s more than just the money
 It’s the lack of security these people endure

" Even if they lost their money and homes, they’ll have such a huge network that they’ll be back on their feet in the time it takes for us peons to earn enough to eat for a week"
 They can never truly understand what it’s like to be poor or ever face that reality again
   So what would happen? It’d be a completely self-serving advert about how “now I realise that we need to do more for our employees

Functionally - you would need an amendment rather than just a law
"  Congressional members aren't paid from annual appropriations and are paid through a salary not based on hours worked, but as their status as members"
" More importantly, members of Congress are constitutional officers"
 The President (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution
" As such, they're all constitutionally entitled to pay"
"  Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution:  >The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States"
"  27th Amendment:  >No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened"
  It also functionally wouldn't do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (AOC for example)
" The shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that *need* that money imminently, which is not the vast majority of Congress and certainly not the President"
 So that amendment would functionally not be much more than a feel-good effort

Sorry if this ends up being long but its angered me for quite some time
  About ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke
 They didn't expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright
 Which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye
" (Not total, just peripheral"
) So she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye
  So after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license
 (Required by law in my province of Canada)
  My father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so I pack them both up in my truck and take them to the DMV
 Me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass
"   Aside from her vision issues, the amazingly quick witted and swift woman I grew up with was VERY unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions"
 It broke my heart and it didn't even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back
"  Well she did, passed with ""Flying colors"" the DMV guy said"
" As a SAR (Search and Rescue) tech, the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me"
"  1 week later, accident number one"
 T-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store
 Not much damage and no injuries thankfully
 Mother still refused to admit she wasn't fit to drive
"  Month later, accident 2"
 She panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car
 Still won't admit any issues
  At this point I'm amazed I didn't have ulcers
 Shortly after accident 2 my father passed away
 I did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license
" She wouldn't do it and for the next few months I spent every day with a knot in my stomach until I spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was ""home from running around""   Then around 1pm I get a call from her cell phone, this phone I bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it"
 I couldn't understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone
 I managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there
"  Upon arriving there are two ambulances, shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb"
  She's sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and I'm terrified she's killed someone
"  Turns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road, began to cross on the cross walk and she didn't see them"
  She thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn't super seriously injured
  Because of my job I knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car
  By the time I had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying
 Threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car
  She even tried to get the DMV worker that passed her fired after that
 She immediately realized she shouldn't of ever gotten it back
 She was actually terrified that she had been driving like that
  Years later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them

You should look up the philosophical thought experiment called the Veil of Ignorance
" It poses a similar question: You have to look at all political, economic, and social ideas without knowing what your socioeconomic position is"
"  E: Pasting the reply from u/ucantharmagoodwoman to give a more accurate description of the experiment, popularly attributed to American philosopher John Rawls"
  You have to look at all that and then design a society that you would want to live in
" But, the catch is, *you don't know what your position will be"
"* You might be at the bottom, you might be at the top"
 The idea is that you'll try to make the society as equitable as possible
 (Kind of like the kid who cuts the cake doesn't get to pick his slice

I don't think it would work
 It's very easy for a politician to take a verbal stance on an issue - it's different to see their actual history and actions
" Politicians would just sound as vague and non-committal as possible, which they usually already do, and we wouldn't be able to hold them accountable if they were being dishonest about their actual platforms and beliefs"
" It would just cause more problems, if anything"

"Police Officers of Reddit, what are you thinking when you see cases like George Floyd?"
""
I am a police officer in a medium sized suburban town in Texas
 I have been in law enforcement for 14 years
" I love my job, I love how I get to help people and I love how I get to cause positive changes in peoples' lives"
 I love how 99
"9% of the time, my badge is shiny"
""
""
today my badge is not shiny
  I am tired of hearing the excuses given by other people for a police officer's misconduct
 I am tired of excuses being made for people who tarnish my badge
 I am so tired of hearing how officers have a stressful job and their misconduct was a result of that stress
" You know who else is under stress? The people who called us, that person whose loved one just committed suicide, the family who called us because they found grandma dead and now we're asking everyone questions, the 7-11 clerk who just had a gun shoved in his face, and even the guy we just put in handcuffs and told him he is losing his freedom"
" Sorry, but our stress is low compared to these folks"
" We might have to go into these situations, but we get to leave them and pretend none of that shit ever happened after our shift is over"
"  I am tired of hearing excuses for the bad police officers, I am tired of the excuse ""well, he puts his life in danger"""
" Sure, I know we put our lives in danger, I've had guns, knives and even swords pulled on me"
" I've responded to bomb threats, suicidal subjects, assaults in progress, robberies in progress, etc"
" You know who else puts their lives in danger? Fire fighters, deep sea fisherman, loggers, people who step foot outside their homes in Chicago"
" We are trained to deal with danger, we are provided with equipment and training to help us survive those dangers"
" Do I face an increased risk of not going home? Sure, but that's why I am at an increased level of awareness at work, so I can respond to threats appropriately without panic and over responding"
  I am tired of hearing about the thin blue line
" I believe in the thin blue line, I believe in looking out for my fellow officers"
" I don't believe in hiding the misconduct or unlawfulness of other officers, and I have always spoken up"
" What many forget, standing behind the thin blue line doesn't mean concealing the misconduct of other officers, it means confronting those officers so they don't do something to ruin their lives, the lives of others, or violate the law or code of conduct"
" It means walking up to the officer with his knee on a suspect's neck and saying ""dude, this is too much, stop"", before the officer commits murder"
" It means walking up to the officer who has been drinking all night and saying ""dude, I'll give you a ride home"""
" Instead of hiding misconduct, prevent it, help your fellow officer not do something to ruin his life or another's life"
" If you do see misconduct, address it, take it to the appropriate level, stop tarnishing my badge"
" We took an oath to uphold the law, uphold our ethics and protect our communities, sometimes that means arresting other police officers or holding them accountable for policy/ethics violations"
  This officer violated the rights of George Floyd and murdered him through his actions
 The officers who were on scene and failed to act are just as responsible
 There are multiple videos of this incident and there is no real question as to what happened
  For those folks who wonder what makes it murder or manslaughter
 Murder is the act of causing death to another human being through an action which a reasonable person would know (or intend) could result in the death of the victim
 Manslaughter is the act of causing death through an act which is reckless in nature
"  Every officer in America is taught about positional asphyxiation and while some departments allow neck restraints, all officers are taught the dangers of neck restraints and are taught not to apply pressure to the back of someone's neck or head when they are proned out on the ground in handcuffs"
  Floyd was handcuffed with little resistance and they were able to walk him across the street to a patrol unit
 Floyd can be seen in a surveillance video falling to the ground next to the unit on the sidewalk side of the unit
" Cell phone footage then shows the officer on top of Floyd's neck on the opposite side of the unit, the street side"
 There is a random man in the background telling Floyd just to get in the car and he can't win
 Floyd can be heard saying he knows and he's done
" This implies that Floyd may have resisted or attempted to escape, but was still restrained in the handcuffs"
 Floyd can be heard multiple times saying he can't breathe
" The cell phone video shows the officer kneeling on top of Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes, with around four of those minutes with Floyd being unconscious"
"  Even if Floyd did attempt to resist or escape, there was no reason to hold him down for eight minutes"
" What was the point of restraining him for so long? Why did the other officer not assist the primary officer with restraining Floyd so they could get him in the patrol unit quicker? Why did the primary officer continue to restrain Floyd by his neck after Floyd became unresponsive? Why can the officer be heard at some point asking Floyd if he is still a tough guy? I can only come up with one answer to all of these questions, and that was the primary officer, Chauvin, wanted to prove to Floyd that Floyd was not such a tough guy"
" I see an officer assaulting another human being, going beyond taking control of a suspect, using force as punishment and ultimately causing the death of another human being"
" I see a second officer who stood and watched and did nothing, despite knowing that what the first officer was doing was a violation of law and policy"
 I see officers who were trying to get back at Floyd for running his mouth and resisting an arrest by using force they KNEW could result in death or serious bodily injury in a situation which did not justify using deadly force
"  This officer committed murder, plain and simple"
 This officer tarnished my badge and the badges of all police officers
" Worst of all, this officer tortured his victim for eight minutes, imagine your last thoughts and memories being those of a police officer, a person who the public is supposed to be able to trust, placing his body weight on your neck, slowly asphyxiating you against hot asphalt while he asks you if you're still a tough guy"
" I hope this officer, and any officer who allowed this to happen, is tried and convicted"
" It's going to be some time before I can polish my badge back to a shine, in the mean time, a family is suffering, a community is burning, all because of one guy who should have never been an officer"
  What do I think? I think assholes like this make my job that much harder and damage the trust I work so hard for
 I think assholes like this ruin peoples' lives and ruin families
 I think assholes like these should be stuck in a prison with all of the people they ever arrested
""
[deleted]
For all the police officers here what would the charges be if one of the bystanders pulled the police officer off of the poor guy?  Wow thanks for gold!
"I'm a former police officer, and so have had plenty of training in physical restraint of individuals being arrested"
"    There is no police academy training officers to kneel on someone's neck to subdue them, That's how you kill a person"
"    There is extensive training on how to avoid seriously injuring a person while restraining them, and I guarantee you every one of these officers was trained to never strike a person in the neck or choke them"
"  The officer who killed him is very clearly liable for manslaughter at the very least, and I think the other officers who stood by have some accountability as well because they knew damn well that was not how you handle a person, and should have stepped up"
""
Absolutely sick to my stomach
   I'm a lieutenant in my home town police department
" I started my day by showing the video to my officers and making sure my people understood that this is murder, plain and simple"
" You never, outside of a life and death struggle, do anything like this"
   George Floyd was handcuffed and on the ground
" If he was still struggling badly enough that they felt a need to hold him down, there's a hundred ways to do it safely"
 Use of force should always be as measured and considered as possible
 There will always be times where an officer sees danger and has to make a split second decision without the luxury of weighing the consequences
 That clearly was not the case here
 He had all the time in the world to think about what he was doing
 He had multiple people there telling him to stop
 And none of his fellow officers intervened
 All of that is why I find this incident particularly disgusting
 They had so many chances to do the right thing
"   Luckily, I have the fortune of working with good people who see this shit for what it is"
" Before the video was over, before I told them that George Floyd died because of this, my officers were muttering things like, ""What the fuck is he doing?"" ""You can't do that shit"" and ""He needs to get off the man's fucking neck!"" Made me way prouder to be their leader than any number of arrests they could make to see that their instincts were not to defend the officer"
"   For what it's worth, I'm glad that they were fired"
" I've heard mention in this thread that one of the officers has been arrested, which is great if true"
 I hope they're all brought to justice
 Their actions (and lack thereof) were completely unconscionable
""
"Not a local, am a fed"
 5 years into the job
 George Floyd was murdered and it’s fucking disgusting
   We’re trained that anything involving the neck is a no-go and is considered deadly force
"   We were also trained that if you make an arrest in a prone position, you search and then immediately move them onto their side or a seated position because the risk of asphyxiation is so great"
" If a suspect says they can’t breathe, believe them and take measures to correct to it"
   This training is reinforced at least twice a year in our use of force training
 These “officers” deserve to spend the rest of their lives in prison

Retired after 28 years
 Nothing less than murder
  All the guys I worked with would never have considered doing something like that
  You treat combative in-custodies once they’re secured as human beings
 Nothing should be personal
"  Once they’ve been subdued and you are safe as an officer, you stand him up, pat him down and understand that your arrestee is at a low point in his life"
  Give him some dignity and you’ll generally get his respect
  It works 90+% of the time
    That man was subdued and nobody should have been on him at that point

I’m a police officer in California
 I am absolutely disgusted by the officers’ actions
 When someone is in our custody you must treat them properly
 I don’t care if they are arrested for murder or forgery

 I had tears streaming down my face watching the video of George Floyd
 We swore to protect our communities and that’s what we set out to do everyday

   A man has lost his life due to the gross negligence of an evil person
 May he Rest In Peace

So I can move freely when time is frozen? Or am I stuck there reading? Cuz if it's the former what's the problem? If the latter I can learn a lot of skills easily
 Or freeze time by touching clifford and having a nap  I cant see a down side either way
"""hey could you hold these textbooks for me?"""
"If you're a very slow learner and a reader, and of you touched a book in some other language, would you get old till you are done deciphering and reading it? Will you go from 10years to 90years in just the flash of normal time???"
"Hell yeah! I get to take my time reading, absorb all the info, and I get enough time to actually read books instead of just skimming! Sign me up!"
So you are telling me that I can freeze time whenever I wish for however long and when I resume time I learn all the knowledge from a book of my choice? Hell yes sign me the fuck up
""
100% would accept
 It gives me so many opportunities to be by myself
 I like reading so if I really had to read something even if I accidentally touched it and hated it I would
 I get to spend hours upon hours by myself and it’s a pretty good way to cheat on tests or steal money or whatever
"So if you accidentally touched a bible for example, you'd be stuck frozen in time for like fifty hours? I'm a bit confused about the monkey's paw fine print of this deal, but it doesn't sound that catastrophic"
"  Edit: yeah, you guys are right - fifty hours is a massive underestimation"
" That would cover the bulk of the old testament, but the whole thing is probably closer to eighty hours"

"** I would murder so many advanced physics and math books, it wouldn't even be funny"

My grade 9 science teacher forced us all to do it
 He said that by colour coding everything you understood the material better because you had to think about it longer to colour code it and understand what other things it was associated with
 Not just zone out and go into transcribing mode
 He also made us do end of unit study guides
" They had to be colour coded,  a set amount of drawings, and unit words and definitions"
 The drawings were doodles based on things in the unit
 He would mark them and hand them back before the test which was great because he knew if he needed to help us with something before we bombed the test
 He was also a mma fighter with cauliflower ears and not the type of guy you would expect to demand rainbow coloured notes
  Edit: There's a lot of people asking for examples so I'll make one up this afternoon

"  So thats' the sad, sick story of how I almost executed my brother"
" I didn't actually carry through with it, obviously, and I guess everyone lived happily ever after"
" My brother got clean and now has a happy family, I'm in college, my sisters leg healed up nicely, and my mom left us after awhile"
""
""
 (But thats' a story for another time)
""
I have two sisters
" One older, and one younger"
 My mom worked hard to make sure each of us felt special and loved
 My dad? Not so much
 He called my older sister *Princess* and my little sister was referred to as *Little Buddy*
" For whatever reason, I got kind of forgotten about"
 I didn't mind most of the time
" I found my dad annoying, demanding, and at times unreasonable"
 I hated the way he bullied my mom and would lash out about things that didn't make sense
" Basically, I thought of my dad at a total brat"
" He'd have a bad day at work, and would find someone to take it out on"
" Usually, my mom and I"
 But I still tried
" I'd try to cuddle up with him, feeling hurt when he'd shrug me off and tell me I need to shower"
 I made gifts for him
" Got good grades, won poetry contests"
 Won awards through bible quiz
 Never argued
 But it never seemed to work
" Before long, he'd find something to yell at me about"
 Things that usually didn't make sense
" If my little sister and I fought, the whole thing was my fault"
 My feet turn in
" I hated when my dad would come to my sporting events, because seeing me run with inturned feet seemed to be humiliating for him"
" One time I was running from one base to another, feeling exhilaration because *I'd done it*"
 *I'd hit a home run*
" The smile died on my face when I heard my dad yell, ""Run with your feet straight! You look stupid!""  As a teen, my mom really stepped up and started insisting that he was going to leave me alone"
" He was never physically abusive, but the way he talked to you made you feel like he was trying to say something that would break you"
"   When I was 15, he was almost successful"
 I went through a couple of really bad months
" A friend died, my dog died, we moved, and my mental health was tanking"
" A week after my friend died (car accident), my dad asked, ""So when are you going to get over it?"" It took me by surprise, because at that time, I wasn't crying or acting out"
" I was just sitting there, eating dinner with the family"
" My mom immediately reacted, gasping out a surprised, ""John!"" and the two of them began fighting again, over my dad's need to mess with me"
" I sat there, head down on the table, thinking, *I'm not allowed to be sad"
 I'm not allowed to feel happy
 I can't get mad
" I'm in pain, and he finds it annoying"
" Just leave me alone, dad"
 Leave me alone
"*  That's when it clicked: my dad, for whatever reason, seemed to hate me"
" I could try to make him like me, but it wasn't going to work"
" As I got older, my goal became to avoid him, his seemed to be to forge a relationship with me with the sole purpose of having a target for his need to bully"
" We were never going to have a healthy father-daughter relationship  That's when it clicked: it's not me, it's him"
" My sisters could like and love him, but I didn't need to respect him"
" I was done trying to please him, trying to do the right things, trying to be the daughter that my dad seemed to want"
  Fast forward almost ten years later
" After the birth of my son, my dad had tried to begin a new relationship with me, because for whatever reason, he latched on to my kid"
" For the sake of my kid, I let my dad have a relationship with him, but I was always monitoring, waiting for my son to develop a personality that would change the way my dad saw him"
 There was no way I was going to let my dad do to my son what he did to me
"   Fortunately, my dad died before the change could happen"
" I sat in the back at his funeral, dry eyed and satisfied"
 Of course my sisters were upset
 They had good relationships
" But for me and my mom, it kind of felt like the wicked witch was at long last dead"
 No more stress
 No more unreasonable expectations
" The egg shells we'd been walking on were swept away, and we could be content"
   I have an uncle in West Virginia that I started to see as my father-figure
" At first, I jokingly would call him dad, testing the waters, waiting for him to remind me that he actually has kids, and doesn't need an adopted daughter"
 I go see him once a year
" But I always felt like maybe, he sees my need to see him as a dad to be annoying"
"   A couple of weeks ago, I asked him if he was coming up for Christmas"
 He said he couldn't
"   But then he said, ""I love you, my daughter"
"""  Sorry this was so long"
 I guess I needed to get that out
""
16 yrs old
 Finally decided to fight back against abusive parents
" Only had to do it once to stop the physical abuse, the brain fucks kept happening"
""
I didn't grow up with the best family
" There was a long period of time where there was constant fighting, and things often went too far"
 I didn't feel safe in many different ways
"  It all culminated to a point when I was 17, disowned, and about to get kicked out"
" But, my vindictive, defensive actions in the past made my mother know that kicking me out wasn't a good idea"
" I know the only reason I could have a roof over my head was becuase my mom isn't a citizen, and she knews I would have reported her for the crime of child abuse (which did happen) which would have put her residency in jeopardy"
"  So, I guess I had to threaten to burn the village in order to feel the warmth of safety"
"  Edit: A lot of people are assuming my mother is illegal, but she's not"
" I'm not exactly sure the mechanism through which she can stay in the United States, but she married my dad (American) and they got divorced"
 She can live and work here but she doesn't have the full protection of the government like me

"When I was a teenager living in rural Alabama, I did nooooot get along with my stepmother"
 She went out of her way to be as mean as she could to me
"  Once when she left the house, she took the mouse for the family computer with her so I couldn't use it while she was gone"
 Well
""
""
"I did her one better by taking a cord from the back, then locking myself in my bedroom until she got home"
  She uses my little baby stepsister against me and tells her to tell me she has a present for me
"   As soon as I unlocked the door, stepmother yanks it out of my hand and starts screaming at me about why the computer won't work"
"  Well, let me tell you, on both sides of me I had a steel pole lying against the wall and a simple glass of water"
  I briefly entertained the notion of smashing her in the face with the pole
 And instead just chucked the harmless water in her face
  Whooo

I had a coworker at a non-commission based retail job where a coworker would repeatedly sabotage my sales so she could get a lot of credit apps and a high gsp (avg hr sales)
 She would overhear my pitch for cards (required) and then lie to the customer so they would apply
 I would have to try and rectify what she said while she hovered over me
" She did many other questionable things, and I reported her multiple times, as did my coworkers (and customers)"
"  Now, one time i got lucky and an 18 yo kid came in yo buy the most expensive desktop we have on display"

" Coworker was watching me the entire time, so i asked if she'd call for the mgr"
 She stone cold ignores me
" I go for the mgr, she prints out paperwork on the computer and tries to sell it to him"
" When i return, she literally yells at me in front of the customer to give her the sale bc she worked too"
 I ignored her & didn't give her the sale
"  When i reported this (as did the customer, he was mortified), i was literally told by my boss ""ignore when she does that"

My brother is ten years younger than me and is a teenager

 I decided to live with him because I was too scared to start a new school mid way through the year
 He then dates this woman who was pretty much the catalyst in destroying their marriage and gets mad at me when I don't treat her like a mother

Former Flat Earthers
 What made you come round?
""
"I talked to a flat-earther about my job working for a company that tracks ship locations, routes, and speeds by satellite"
 We also had ways of monitoring carbon emissions based on fuel consumption and known weather conditions
 None of this would work at all if the earth was flat
 Not a jot of it
" I could only explain the most basic concepts, but it was enough for him to understand and realise that I was right and that he’d been convinced by someone who had no practical experience of the spherical nature of the Earth"
 I think that’s what really did it - my experience was really tangible
 This happens then this happens then we measure this etc etc

" no theory, just practice"
" A bit like showing a child a rock dropping to the ground in order to explain gravity, rather than giving them the whole theoretical shebang"
 Y’know?  Edit: sorry it’s a bit rambling I’m so damn tired
The mobius strip earthers had more compelling arguments

Kyrie Irving hasn’t been doing press conferences

"  ""for 5 years I believed the Earth was flat, then I turned 6"""
"I convinced a flat earther, temporarily, by asking him if it was possible for a sphere to be so large that you could not tell it was a sphere my simply being on the surface of it"
" It took him a while, I used an analogy of a extremely long line that was so slightly curved you could not tell so by looking at a small section of it"
 Eventually he said yes to the sphere and I told him that was how big the earth is
"         A few days later he reverted, most of these people aren’t mentally stable, they believe in a lot of conspiracies"
"      Edit: Corny edit, but  as connoisseur of flat earth content my personal favorite is [Professor Dave](https://www"

I watched a documentary about flat earthers called “Truth behind the curve” and my analysis from watching that these flat earthers are a group of people who found a community to be a part of
" It’s a shame their community is based on a lie, but I saw a bunch of people who were to be part of A community"
"   Most of the people were social awkward and whatnot, and so an opportunity to be an influential figure within the community so they double down on their flawed logic"
"   The more against you are of them, the harder they rep their flatness"
   TLDR: I see flat earthers as a group of lonely people looking for a community that will accept them
  edit: wtf did not expect this comment to blow up
" Thanks for the silver, and the dialogue everyone"

"I was debating a flat earther in Mexico, and I asked him about how GPS worked if there were no satellites"
 He said that they had devices in the ground to route you
  I told him the Mexican government is barely able to put decent water pipes in the ground; would he really think they had the tech to put routing devices in the ground?  He chuckled with a thousand mile gaze

"A serious answer here  The thing that made me stop was just the question ""why would nasa lie to you""  I will try replying to all of yall but will go to a study hall so ill reply later"
I spent about a year infiltrating the flat Earth community on Instagram
 I garnered a decent following with an account dedicated to flat earth travel photos (an intentionally absurd premise)
 In that time I learned a quite a bit about the community including how to discern the trolls from the real deal
 The majority of legit flat earthers are extremely distrustful of anything the government says or does
" These same people are 9/11 truthers, Holocaust deniers, and anti-vaxxers and they connect these conspiracies together"
" Many of them have also attached flat Earth theory to religion, magic, or mysticism"
 Before my infiltration I’d always considered conspiracies fun
 Like they were the fan fiction of real life
 Now they mostly make me sad
" For all the phony accounts like mine, there are still plenty of people out there willing to drop a couple of hundred dollars on a flat Earth convention"

How would you feel if the U

"Make it a holiday and have voting last either a week or a 24 hour period so people deemed ""essential workers"" can actually have a chance"

Serious question: are elections in the US not on Sundays but on regular working-days?

 Especially if they kept their 4th of July energy for that day
In Australia it’s on a weekend but polling stations are open earlier in the week so you can go earlier if you are working

but people like to go on the day so you can get your democracy sausage
"Actually coming from another country, I really cannot understand, why it should not be a holiday or a Sunday (where most people have time)"

 You can enrol and vote at the same time

At best it would be akin or Presidents day or Labor day

Suicide Prevention Megathread

"As someone who's struggled with suicidal thoughts and still do on occasion I'd like to advice against a trend I've noticed on reddit, and it's this thing about instantly linking to suicide prevention organizations"
" I personally understand that it's ment with good intent, but on someone who is suicidal and not quite in their right mind it often has the opposite effect of where it feels like you're being shoved into a corner or dumped as someone elses problem"
" More often than not someone suicidal wants to talk to a normal person, someone who will care or listen to them, of course I am not telling strangers that you have to be that person - I know it shouldn't be anyone elses responsibility, all I am trying to say is that if you really want to help someone or make them feel better, linking them to something else is not a great way to go about it, it's much better worked into a conversation as a suggestion on the side"
"  Again, I don't want to come off as a dick here - I think it's great that so many people care enough to want to encourage others to seek help, but try to keep this in mind"
 That feeling of being pushed away or getting a predictable and generic answer often makes you feel more isolated and more depressed

  ***** When you have depression it’s like it snows every day
  Some days it’s only a couple of inches
" It’s a pain in the ass, but you still make it to work, the grocery store"
" Sure, maybe you skip the gym or your friend’s birthday party, but it IS still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight"
 Probably better to just head home
"  Your friend notices, but probably just thinks you are flaky now, or kind of an asshole"
  Some days it snows a foot
 You spend an hour shoveling out your driveway and are late to work
 Your back and hands hurt from shoveling
 You leave early because it’s really coming down out there
 Your boss notices
  Some days it snows four feet
 You shovel all morning but your street never gets plowed
" You are not making it to work, or anywhere else for that matter"
 You are so sore and tired you just get back in bed
" By the time you wake up, all your shoveling has filled back in with snow"
 Looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are
" You don’t feel like calling them back, too tired from all the shoveling"
 Plus they don’t get this much snow at their house so they don’t understand why you’re still stuck at home
" They just think you’re lazy or weak, although they rarely come out and say it"
  Some weeks it’s a full-blown blizzard
" When you open your door, it’s to a wall of snow"
" The power flickers, then goes out"
" It’s too cold to sit in the living room anymore, so you get back into bed with all your clothes on"
 The stove and microwave won’t work so you eat a cold Pop Tart and call that dinner
" You haven’t taken a shower in three days, but how could you at this point? You’re too cold to do anything except sleep"
  Sometimes people get snowed in for the winter
 The cold seeps in
 No communication in or out
 The food runs out
" What can you even do, tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands? How far away is help? Can you even get there in a blizzard? If you do, can they even help you at this point? Maybe it’s death to stay here, but it’s death to go out there too"
"  The thing is, when it snows all the time, you get worn all the way down"
 You get tired of being cold
" You get tired of hurting all the time from shoveling, but if you don’t shovel on the light days, it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days"
" You resent the hell out of the snow, but it doesn’t care, it’s just a blind chemistry, an act of nature"
" It carries on regardless, unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world"
"  Also, the snow builds up in other areas, places you can’t shovel, sometimes places you can’t even see"
 Maybe it’s on the roof
 Maybe it’s on the mountain behind the house
" Sometimes, there’s an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it"
" A veritable Act of God, nothing can be done"
 The neighbors say it’s a shame and they can’t understand it; he was doing so well with his shoveling
  -  I don’t know how it went down for Anthony Bourdain or Kate Spade
" It seems like they got hit by the avalanche, but it could’ve been the long, slow winter"
 Maybe they were keeping up with their shoveling
 Maybe they weren’t
" Sometimes, shoveling isn’t enough anyway"
" It’s hard to tell from the outside, but it’s important to understand what it’s like from the inside"
  I firmly believe that understanding and compassion have to be the base of effective action
" It’s important to understand what depression is, how it feels, what it’s like to live with it, so you can help people both on an individual basis and a policy basis"
 I’m not putting heavy shit out here to make your Friday morning suck
" I know it feels gross to read it, and realistically it can be unpleasant to be around it, that’s why people pull away"
  I don’t have a message for people with depression like “keep shoveling
""" It’s asinine"
"  Of course you’re going to keep shoveling the best you can, until you physically can’t, because who wants to freeze to death inside their own house? We know what the stakes are"
 My message is to everyone else
 Grab a fucking shovel and help your neighbor
 Slap a mini snow plow on the front of your truck and plow your neighborhood
" Petition the city council to buy more salt trucks, so to speak"
"    Depression is blind chemistry and physics, like snow"
" And like the weather, it is a mindless process, powerful and unpredictable with great potential for harm"
" But like climate change, that doesn’t mean we are helpless"
" If we want to stop losing so many people to this disease, it will require action at every level"

" Because when I'm at my loneliest, I don't have anyone to turn to, no-one to go see, to talk to, despite my best efforts"
" I have her because I know if I died, something would miss me, so I can't leave her"
"   I left her at the dog boarding for an extra day after getting back from a work trip, earlier this week"
" I found myself calling for her, and she wouldn't come"
" For the first time in years, I just cried"
 I missed her
 I wanted to sit on the couch and just pet her like she always loves
" Fortunately, I could just grab her the next day"
 But it reminded me how important she is to my mental health
   I recently turned down a job that would have required me to move to a place where I would have even less familial and friend support
" I would have been traveling most of the year, so I would have to give up my dog"
 I'm glad I did
" I had one friend tell me to ""absolutely not take the job""; he said if I took it, he gave me 6 months before I jumped off a bridge"
 I can't say he would be wrong
"   I used work to redirect my loneliness over the past several years, which ended up making it worse as it alienated me from those that I was close to"
 And then the company abandoned me; hired someone above me that openly tells people inside and outside of the company that he's trying to fire me
" I have the CEO and President behind me, so he can't touch me; they know what I did for the company, my sacrifice, my skill, my dedication and loyalty"
" I now have much less responsibilities, so I can relax"
"   Now, I'm here, with my dog, trying to decompress from my job, make more friends, actually date girls for the first time in many years of unsuccessfully trying"
 Things are starting to look better

I’m the mother of a toddler who died of cancer
 There is nothing anyone could do to prevent me from killing myself- besides listening and being present
 I didn’t reach out to anyone
 Being suicidal means you want to die- no one could have talked me out of it
 My family knew I was struggling and they took shifts watching me
"   They bought me my favorite foods, watched Ru Paul’s Drag Race with me for weeks (seriously"
""
 for some reason it was the only thing I could watch
) They listened to me cry and didn’t try to give me solutions
 They just said “I know”
 We had a code word- potato
" If I said potato, that meant that I needed someone to be physically present with me"

 quickly
"   There was always a plan for the next day- “Tomorrow we’re going to have lunch at that Mexican place, ok?” “Tomorrow let’s look for a special garden marker for Miles"
” I think that was a big part of it- having a plan for the next day meant I had to keep going
  It’s been almost four months since my 3 year old died and I’m still living
 That’s pretty fucking amazing

 My issue with Cabin in the Woods is those people didn't know beforehand what might or was going to happen
 Michael Douglas' character knew about the organization and how Sean Penn's character talked about the experience

"I was at a lecture a couple of years ago, performed by two doctors who’d undergone treatment for breast cancer and written a book about it together"
  I remember her talking about her diagnosis
" She was a breast cancer surgeon herself, you couldn’t make it up"
" She walked into the room, saw her own scans with the doctor and her heart dropped, she barely heard a word he said because she couldn’t stop the flood of information she was getting"
" Looking at the scan she knew if she’d need surgery, chemo, radiotherapy, how long it would be, what her estimated survival was"
"  I don’t think they discussed it like a group project, but I suppose she couldn’t stop herself from listening to her own internal monologue since it was her own field"
" I remember her saying she’d found it, in hindsight, an incredible learning opportunity regarding how to interact with patients, and that she thought about it a lot"
""
It depends on what I'm going in for
" As a background, I'm an oncologist so I've trained in internal medicine before"

I dont get involved in the management

"The pace and density of the conversations is different, I'm sure"
"  I'm an emergency physician who has over time treated various physicians in my community including internists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, some from my hospital and some not"
  Keep in mind that each specialty is quite different from the others
"  The Rad Onc, for example, thinks and speak differently than the Ortho Surgeon, and I felt like my treatment of each of them was really quite similar to treating a professor of engineering"
"  Academically minded people tend to ask lots of questions and research stuff while you're out of the room, as compared to populations that request a more paternalistic bent and just want you to tell them what to do so they can get on with their day"

" She doesn't really go to another doctor, just calls them to ask about stuff"

"  For stuff like getting ultrasounds etc, then yes they do discuss stuff like its a group project"
""
I hope you get some doctors in here to give personal answers
 Paul Kalanithi did address this a bit in his book When Breath Becomes Air
 At first in his cancer treatment he was very involved in the decision making and the way he described the conversation with his oncologist was more like a collaboration
" Later, she reminded him that he didn't have to participate in the decision making and that he could just let her be the doctor and focus on himself"
 He ended up taking her up on this offer
" So even between the same patient and doctor, the relationship varied"
""
"I'm an ER doctor, and sometimes I have other doctors as patients"
  For the most part they're pretty good patients because they can give a good description of their symptoms in a way that's useful the me
  They usually ask good questions and are well equipped to have an informed discussion about their diagnosis and treatment
"  Sometimes it's hard for me to dial back my ""patient talk"" where I simplify medical terms for laypeople"
  Sometimes it's challenging if their area of expertise is totally unrelated to the issue at hand and they don't recognize their limited understanding
  The worst patients are those who have just a little medical knowledge and think they know everything
"  Some version of: ""My aunt is a nurse, and she said a need a whole body MRI for this runny nose"

Doctor here (family medicine)
" I self diagnose most things, but for my 1 year old daughter I decided a while ago that I don't want to do that for her"
 So her pediatrician doesn't know I'm a doctor - I never told her
" I want her to treat me like any other parent, and explain everything to me like I'm 5 years old"
 I'm afraid of of being too nonchalant with my daughter's health that I'll miss something (or the doctor assuming I know more than I really do)
   It's actually a strategy I've adopted since on myself- if I go to a doctor (say a gynecologist for a routine check up) I sometimes just don't say what I do so I can legitimacy ask dumb questions about things that I should really know- or so that the other doctor won't leave out important info that they assume I know for fear of insulting me
"   On the other hand, my regular doctors do know, such as the gynecologist who saw me through my pregnancies, and that enables more complex and nuanced disscusions about health decisions- as in debating questions and giving me options that he wouldn't necessarily do with it he patients, bc he can be sure I understand the medical pros and cons well once I'm given a basic explanation"

Look
 this post is old
 It's outdated
 it's honestly shit
 I do not know why I keep getting awards
 so listen here fuckers
 I no longer condone [playemulator
com](https://playemulator
com)
" Instead, go to [https://www"
retroarch
com/](https://www
retroarch
com/) and download the installer
 I'm going to teach you how to play all the games you would have played on playemulator much better on something that doesn't reek
 Do not worry about computer specs
 my shitty surface pro 5 can run it
" it's fine  install retroarch, then open it up and click load cores"
 It should be the first option you see
" Select download a core, then choose a core for the system you want"
 Wanna play pokemon? grab a GBA core
 Mega man? get an NES core
" Final fantasy VII? we'll come back to that one  Install the core and you're ready to play a game; but first, you'll need a game! I don't believe I'm allowed to link to it directly, but check out a website called Vimm's lair if you want to accquire some illegal roms the safe way  Download the game files and move them to a cozy safe folder"
" Don't forget to unzip them! some of them, mainly playstation games, will require 7zip to open"
 You should really have 7zip anyway so install it if you don't
" when your roms are all nice and snug, open up retroarch and scroll down on the left sidebar until you find an option labelled ""import content"
""" Select ""import from directory"" and select your snugg little rom folder as the directory"
" Any folders inside that folder will be scanned if they also have game files in them, so keep that in mind! now, if you did that right, you should see your games organised by console underneath the import content option"
" Now, you can play them! wonder of wonders! hook up a controller or map the buttons to keys on your computer if you hate fun"
" You can also map hotkeys to speed up or pause the game! woo! if you wanna play ps1 games, you'll need bios; that's basically the playstation's soul! I'll cover that in just a second!  Oh, and if you want to emulate DS games: Don't! Use melonds or dsmume instead! the full versions, not the cores on retroarch! Retroarch has a fit when you emulate a touch screen, and is generally slower when playing ds games!  Since you motherfuckers insist on continually giving me rewards, I'll tell you how to emulate PS1 Games on retroarch"
 You'll need a core
 I like duckstation myself
" To make it work you'll need ps1 bios! You can find downloads pretty easily online, but not all of them are safe! If you ever download a "
exe file from a site claiming to offer downloads of ROMS or BIOSes delete it quick! Once you've got the ps1 bioses you need (they should be multiple files) you need to find your retroarch folder
" It'll be in the folder you installed it to; I installed to my desktop, but if you installed it like a normal person it'll be in your program files folders, which you can get to from ""this pc"
""" don't touch the system folder, you'll break things"
" when you've found the retroarch folder, open it up and go to the folder called system"
 this is different from the system folder I told you not to touch! don't get them mixed up or you'll REALLY break things! put the bios files into the system folder (the one inside the retroarch folder
") That's it! You don't need to do anything else, retroarch automatically takes the bios from that folder when you launch duckstation"
" Add your ps1 games the way you would any other game, then launch them! I really *really* reccomend a controller to play ps1 games"
  Under no circumstances are you to attempt to play n64 games on retroarch
 You should use project 64
" It's as simple as can be, just download it and open a game and you are playing it"
 the complicated stuff is the plugins and configuration to make certain games work
  &#x200B;  **The Tutorial is over
" Below this point is the old comment, which is what actually got me most of those awards in the first place"
**  [Playemulator
com](https://Playemulator
com) has almost every game from NES era to NDS era
" Most of the pokemon games, the good sonic games, several N64 classics and countless hidden gems"
"  &#x200B;  Edit: It is also browser based, so no downloadEdit 2: yes, it saves and loads saves great  It's been a year please stop giving me awards  &#x200B;  I still get awards for on this comment"

Once had a patient whose wife shook their baby to death
  He wanted help reconnecting with his wife
"   At the time I was a young father of a newborn myself, and he triggered a lot of fear in me for my own child, a deep loathing of his spouse, and pity (the ""how pathetic"" kind) for the patient"

I work with kiddos who have experienced some kind of abuse/trauma (90% of my clients have been sexually abused)
 I have a lot of holy shit moments but not from judgment of my clients but from what happened to them

"It's not often I get to talk about my profession, but here goes: I was working at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center and had a client come in who was a self proclaimed ""drug lord"""

 Included in this history was how he got to where he was currently at
"   During the conversation, this man admitted to selling his sister into sex slavery, forcibly injecting her with several sedatives and narcotics, and having several people ""teach her a lesson"" (what this meant, he never shared)"
" He told this story with a blank face, smiling only when he recalled the ""good times"", which he referred to as times when he had enough heroin to get through the day"
"   I'm not sure where he is at now, but this man inspired me to work with victims of sex trafficking, because not only do they deal with the stigma of ""selling their bodies"", they often manage drug addictions"

Therapist here
 I don’t think I’ve ever judged clients
 My job is to understand them and their experiences and help them make the improvements they are ready to make
"   But I have very directly made my thoughts clear about choices, especially choices parents make for/about their kids"
 This probably comes off as judgement depending on the clients insecurity about the topic
"   One example was telling parents of a child I was working with with a severe mood disorder (that had made both suicidal and homicidal threats and attempts) that it did not seem like a good idea to buy the young kid a gun, especially the week after the mother spent the session sharing her fears that the child would murder her"

   My wife had a heart attack
  My daughter attempted suicide
   And my mom broke her hip and had laid on her floor for a week before being found (she drank and ate from the dogs bowls)
  I got that call within ten minutes of setting up the last funeral

"Back when I was 10 there was a competition for schoolkids to write a treatment for an episode of Doctor Who, with the best one being developed into an full episode in the next series and the winner receiving a writing credit"
" I was a huge fan of DW at the time and the competition was actually run through schools, so my teacher made the entire class do it, but I was very excited"
"  I began writing a story about the Doctor landing on a planet full of defective cybermen, who's programming had gone a wry and had been left on this asylum planet to rot"
 The Doctor lands there in response to a mysterious distress call from a woman and attempts to find and save her while avoiding the dangerous dysfunctional cybermen and the looming threat of planetary destruction at the hands of the normal cybermen
 I finished my short treatment and gave it to my teacher to submit
" Unfortunately it turned out the competition was very strict about the formatting of submissions and mine was returned because I had used the wrong formatting in some way, it seemed like a weird reason"
 I was a bit disappointed and that was the end of that
"  But then, a year or two later, there was an episode of DW called Asylum of the Daleks, which seemed incredibly similar to my story except with Daleks"
" So incredibly, eerily, similar in fact, that to this day I am absolutely convinced that Steven Moffat saw my script and came up with a formatting excuse so that he could remove me from the competition, steal my story, change the bad guys and claim it as his own"

"Well, this might be a long one"
  I grew up around a mother with dissociative disorder as well as narcissism
" She was addicted to opiates as far back as I can remember, and would do anything to get them, and I mean anything"
"  Growing up, it wasn't rare for her to have a tantrum during one of her highs and beat the shit out of me, break me down by picking apart every little thing she knew I was afraid or self-conscious of, and actively sabotage my relationship with my father and siblings"
"  She would be up for days at a time, pass out standing up with her eyes glassed over and back hunched, and when she festered once again start moving and otherwise destroying everything in the house"
"  There were times where I'd leave and the house would be clean, and come home and it would look as though a pissed off tornado had run through the house i"

" broken glass, animal feces, dirty clothes, roaches, empty pill bottles, ground-up pill residue, and other miscellaneous things littering the house"
" On particularly bad nights she would hallucinate, and during those times it wouldn't be uncommon to find pools of her blood on the ground from running through glass"
  I remember being up for days at a time because her and my father would scream at each other for days at a time without stopping; actively trying to get me to pick one side or the other even if it meant barging into my room at 4 am to begin their screaming match where I could watch
"  She manipulated me, abandoned me at times in the middle of nowhere when she'd meet up with her various sugar daddies (she was still with my dad during this), and never once apologized during her brief moments of mental clarity"
" If anything, she would blame everything but herself"
 In her mind she was infallible
  Money was always a big issue since she couldn't work in such a state
" She sold some of her pills, yes, but ultimately those funds were used to buy more drugs anyway"
" Because of this, we were homeless frequently, without power and water for literally years at a time, and barely ever had any food"
 It was almost every night I went to sleep with the only thing I'd have eaten that day being a school lunch
" On weekends, sometimes I didn't eat at all"
  The rest of my family had no clue this was happening
" During the summer when I was 16, my aunt whom I hadn't talked much with since I was a lot younger got in touch"
 She asked if I'd like to come to stay with them in Texas for a few weeks during the summer
"  Of course I said yes, and I was absolutely ecstatic"
 I didn't bother asking my parents since I'd be very much surprised if they even noticed I was gone so they were unaware
 My aunt drove up all the way to Iowa and stayed the afternoon with us
  My parents seemed to lack the cognition to recognize she was even there out of the blue so they didn't come out of their room
" As I stated before would happen frequently, when she arrived our house was fairly clean"
" We left for a bit to go get food, and when we returned the tornado had already passed"
"  As she told me when we were on our way to Texas: the thing that bothered her the most wasn't that our house had suddenly gone to hell, it was that I didn't even react to it"
" Instead, I tiptoed around the debris and started packing my things without a word"
"  This deeply unsettled her, and ultimately she asked me if I was safe where I lived"
" I said yes, as it was all I had ever known"
" She told me that what she saw frightened her, and she wanted me to come live with her in Texas"
" Thinking that she was joking, I brushed it off"
" After a few days down there though, I knew I had to do it"
" They showed me love, compassion, and care that I'd never even known existed prior to this and it shook me to my core"
"  So we decided, I was going to get emancipated from my parents and move in with them"
" Ultimately, this involved sitting in a courthouse across from my parents and their lawyer"
"  The judge asked why I wanted to leave, and I explained the above"
" I expressed the love and compassion I'd experienced for the first time in my life, and that I wanted to, for once, live in peace"
"  Their lawyer rebutted, ""To me, it seems as though you have no respect for your parents"
" Is it because of their financial situation? It looks as though you're attached to the perks of living in a family that makes a reasonable amount of money, and not that you want to leave because they're unfit parents"
"""  My mother and father joined in, hooting and hollering actively trying to break me down as they have so many times before"

"  Finally, the judge asked me to speak"
"  With as level a stare as I could muster, I looked at mother, my father, and their lawyer across from me and said ""If you're asking me if I have no respect for my parents, then you are correct"

" I no longer have respect for them because they have-""  As I was nearly finished, my mother, as she had so many times in the past began to squirm and scream at me from across the table"
" ""HE'S LYING THE LITTLE BASTARD IS JUS-""  Until the Judge slammed his gavel down and cut the room; my mother staring up at him in complete and utter disbelief"
"  I looked at her, keeping the tears I knew were right behind the corner at bay and said, ""For once in your life; for once in my life, behave as an adult"
" You can't stop me by simply yelling over me anymore, you have nothing to hold over me now"
 You can do nothing
"""  As I spoke, the judge motioned to his officer who moved towards my mother"
 Her expression still frozen in complete bewilderment as the officer aggressively told her to get up out of her chair and escorted her out of the room
"  The judge looked to me, my aunt, my father, and his lawyer with one sweeping glance and then spoke"
"  ""I am sorry that you have had to deal with this for so long young man"
 There's nothing more that you or anyone else needs to say
 You deserve to live a normal life as a normal kid and it's obvious to me now that your parents are unfit to produce that kind of environment
" You will go back to Texas with your Aunt, and we will regularly have our social workers in touch to check in on how you are doing"
" Make the most of this second chance, good luck young man"
 Adjourned
"""  Though the bang of his gavel was the only noise that permeated the room, all I could hear was the ringing in my ears"

" She huffed about not having had a break all day, which I ignored cos not my fucking problem, but internally I was put out about it, because it was totally fucking pointless to be such a twat about things"
"  About 2 weeks in I get promoted to Supervisor as I was clearly extremely competent by their usual standards (I could walk and fart at the same time) but she also gets promoted to Floor Manager, so she continues to work her little power trips and try and lord it over me (and everyone else)  4 weeks after that, I get another promotion to Floor Manager, and at this point we're equals, so she can't boss me around anymore"

"  When I got back, a lot needed fixing but in particular there were 2 teenage employees that had been fired/suspended on numerous occasions"
" They were generally lazy, rude jackasses that shouldn’t have been hired in the first place"
" Problem was, they both had aggressive helicopter moms that intimidated the manager into rescinding any punishments"
"  Once I came back, I took stock of our employees and had a long talk with the entire leadership team"
" I learned which employees caused which problems, who was unreliable, who had a regular habit of skipping shifts, texting on shift, etc"
" I fired about a half dozen that first week, including those two I mentioned"
" That night, both moms called my personal cell to scream at me (our numbers are listed in the online scheduling tool so employees can find shift covers more easily)"
"  They demanded to know why I fired them, threatened to sue, have me arrested, accused me of discrimination (against their white middle-class sons), etc"

 But one day he came home a little too late for his mom's liking
 She said she'd take his keys to his motorcycle and that he'd lost privileges to it
  The fact of the matter is that he bought the motorcycle himself and he needed it to get to *school* as well as work
 He laughed in her face and she didn't do anything

You could think of the “few hours per day” as a really easy part-time job that pays for your housing
The summer before college I worked in a nursing home under the table for 2 weeks as they had their security system revamped
  My job was to make sure only people with employee cards got buzzed in and none of the residents got out of the blue door that led to the dementia ward
 The gig payed well enough but FML it didn't pay nearly enough for the nurses & the shit I saw they had to deal with
"  I had some good memories at least, especially of a blind veteran that would always stop by at the same time every day to chat"
 He loved telling old war stories and I enjoyed hearing them he was good at telling them
  But the dementia ward would ruin that every night
 So many of them screaming they had been kidnapped or that they didn't know where they were
" I remember one had gotten out, kind little old lady in her pajamas I found her on the side of the road trying to hitch hike to the mall"
 She was so determined to go I had to lie to her and say I was delivering a package before I could take her so I could get her back to the home and tell the nurses

"No, I wouldn’t"
" My job can be fairly demanding, and I like my free time for working on my hobbies or relaxing"

" It was very civil and honestly uplifting to see black protesters working with white police officers in this political climate, and in a way that makes sure no one gets hurt, innocent people don't lose homes or business"
  Another protester got up and said that he talked to the neighborhood association asking permission to use certain streets and how they need to be respectful of the property because destroying it isn't going to help anyone
"  BUT THEN!! some stupid little white kid got up, and I quote, ""they want us to be peaceful"

I want to start by saying that when I say Black Lives Matter- there is an implied “too” at the end
" I am NOT saying my life matters more, or your life matters less"
" Just that mine is equally important and not viewed as such by unfortunately, many people"
 “All Lives Matter” is disrespectful because it negates the purposeful attention we are trying to draw to black injustice specifically
 I need you to please understand that racism is not the racism they taught us in school anymore
  Modern racism is giving black people higher interest rates or bad loans (which a bank was sued millions for doing in 2017!)
 It’s relators purposely not showing black people houses in nicer areas
" It’s companies only hiring 1-5 black people for their quota and not for their merit, which is ironically racist towards whites who potentially deserved it more- spurring more division"
 It’s colleges only accepting black people to make themselves look good on paper instead of actually valuing that students strengths & potential
 It’s enforcing laws in school that don’t allow black people to wear their natural hair because it is “unprofessional” and a “distraction” to other students
 It’s makeup companies only having 1-3 dark foundation shades because we are a “demographic” without money & thus not worth pursuing- and then suddenly coming out with more shades once they see how successful Rihanna was when she acknowledged us
" It’s crooked police purposely going into low income areas, scanning license plates, and purposely ticketing people they know cannot afford it, so that they will go to jail for outstanding tickets and become a part of the for-profit prison pipeline"
" It’s fashion companies & movies using damaging stereotypes of black people instead of showing how diverse and beautiful our people are, thus instilling an untrue idea of what “black people” are to others across the world (imagine you’re from a place with no black people- if all the movies & shows portray us a certain way, you’ll assume that must be true)"
"  When  I first started at my old place of employment, a very nice tech company, I had a black  janitor stop me one morning as I was heading up to the office, tears in  his eyes"
" He gripped my shoulder; his hands frail, wrinkled- and told me  how proud of me he was"
 How happy he was that a little black girl was  working at “one of them tech companies”
 I hugged him & told him  thank you
 When I tell you I ran to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out
"  I was so grateful, but that is a heavy burden to carry- not only was I  working for me, I was working for him, for all my ancestors who didn’t  have a chance"
" And when I was let go 2 months ago, it hit hard because it felt like  not only did I fail me, I failed them"
" I realize it was not my fault, a  virus hit the country and I was a part of a mass layoff"
" But do you see  how race played into my emotional state, something most others wouldn’t  have to deal with?  So please, when you see Black Lives Matter, when you see protest, know that all we’re asking for is change"
" Yes we have civil rights, but why are you scoffing at us asking for more? Why are we expected to accept the bare minimum? As a kid (mind you I was born in 1996) I was given the talk that my skin means I have to conduct myself a certain way, in certain environments, for my own safety"
 That people will fear me for simply having too much melanin
" That I will be black first, yourelovely second until I die"
" I am trying my hardest to create a future where I don’t have to give my kids that same speech, where I don’t have to pass down that generational trauma"
"  If you have questions about the protesting, the movement, modern racism- ask me please! I know it can be a heated topic and the only way to change that is to have an open dialogue and educate"
" This is me offering the olive branch, me saying I am hurting and still have nothing but love in my heart"
 Too often we are too busy trying to share our thoughts that we don’t hear others
"  EDIT: I've gotten a lovely amount of responses- I'm in Boston & its currently 12:13 am, I'm trying to get a semi-regular sleep schedule on track so I'll probably be heading to bed soon, please know if I don't get back to you tonight I will tomorrow!

When I was 22 I lost my leg due to a suicide attempt and becoming an amputee as a result of my own stupid actions was extremely difficult but I decided I was going to keep living and really see what I could do with the time and resources I have
" I always thought I was too stupid and ugly to do anything with my life but once there wasn't much left to lose I got my shit together stopped being a victim and now I'm 25 going to school, clean and sober, no friends or girlfriend or family really but I'm content being alone with my thoughts and I think my prosthetic looks pretty badass"

  He told me to ride into town (I think Springfield?) which was only 10 miles away and take a few days off and rest
"  Which is what I did, because hey, one more day wouldn't matter, and the worst that would happen is that I'd pack it in and go home"

 It had a lot of internal and external problems

I went to Dairy Queen with my daughter

  The cute girl at the walk-up window asked my daughter what the kitten's name was

I was visiting portland for a wedding that lined up with my birthday as well

I accidentally mixed up an inside joke with the wrong friend group with disastrous results
  Friend group #1: The “joke” was when someone calls and asks who’s all there we would add Darrell to the list of names
 Darrell wasn’t a real person
" The joke wasn’t really funny, and made no sense out of context, but I guess that’s why it was an inside joke"
  Friend group #2: I was hanging out playing some drinking games with a bunch of people that I hadn’t hung out with in a while
 It was a kind of get together to remember a friend that they had who had recently died in a car accident
" I didn’t know him that well, but I was always down to party"
"   Anyway the phone rings, and the person who answered started listing off names"
 Sorting my cards for another round of Presidents and Assholes I offhandedly said “heh and Darrell!”
   It was the typical record scratch moment where everyone stopped and looked at me
 Darrell was the name of the friend who had just died
  This happened in 2002 and I still think about it all the time

"When I was in the 4th grade, I lived in the middle of nowhere and there was practically no minorities, just white country people"
 This Mexican family had just moved in and could barely speak any English and I befriended one of the kids my age in school
 He came over to my place and we were both joking around about his bad English
 Just doing what kids do
" I would pretend to speak with his accent and then he would copy and it was silly, stupid and innocent"
 My mom told me I was being really inconsiderate and how uncool it was to make fun of someone for not being able to speak English
 I felt terrible
 The next day at school my friend came up to me and started joking with me again but I just shook my head and looked down at my desk in embarrassment
 He had no idea what was wrong and I was too young and dumb to be able to explain my behavior to him
  As I grew older I spent probably 20 years thinking about that day and how much of a shit I was to be friendly one day and then without explaining anything just stop talking to him out of embarrassment
 I felt really bad about it for a long time and often laid awake at night thinking about it
 I ended up finding him on Facebook about a year ago and we friended each other so I told him how bad I felt about it and apologized
 He just laughed it off and said it was no big deal and he was still really thankful to find someone as friendly as me when he didn't know anyone here
 He said he figured my mom had said something to me about it and it never bothered him
"  I don't know if maybe he was just being nice to me or not, but it was such a relief to hear it"

How do you feel about ’how would you feel?’ posts being banned?
We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on this one
 A lot of feedback
" We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \_\_\_\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a ""shower thought"" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules"
" Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub"
" Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward"
  We do understand that there’s some nuance to this
" Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions"
"  For example:  * “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion"
 * “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question
  Our philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content
" However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules"
" If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review"
  Thank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy
 We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration

"Askreddit removed the ability to type in the body of an Askreddit post specifically because posters would use it as a soapbox to voice their opinion, without much room for discussion because they already answered their own question"
" ""How would you feel"" posts are basically statements"
""
How about we get rid of posts that are basically just asking what your username is?
"Why not, add the “your username is X, what happens?” posts to the ban and I’m in"

You guys should add a repost rule that doesn’t allow questions that have been asked in a certain time like a month as an example

I try to embarrass my daughter every chance I get as I feel it is truly a dads job to do such things

" I was bopping my head, instead of the utter embarrassment her friends started dancing around, and I've become the ""cool"" dad"
 Now I've gotta do this all the time when I get her from school
 Its also led to her friends coming over all the time and listening to music at top volume
 My daughter trolled me while I was trying to troll her
 Be careful it backfires

"What do you think of the idea of ""adopting"" elderly people whose children have died as parents or grandparents, much the same way we adopt children whose parents have died as our own?"
""
"This reminds me of the programs where kindergartens take the children into aged care facilities and the children pick a buddy, and then write letters, draw pictures and visit their buddy"
""
My town actually has an “adopt a grandparent” program at some of the nursing homes
 They made up profiles with their interests and what they liked to talk about so you could “choose a grandparent” you’d get along with well
Volunteer to do anything at a senior center
 They'll adopt you first
""
A similar concept is having orphanages for children with elderly living with them - those who don't have a family or have been put up in some kind of assisted living
"   The kids grow up with grandparents who tell them stories and teach them how to be better people, the elderly get genuine love and affection"
"   There are some centers like this in India, and overall the benefits are pretty good"
 The elderly are more healthy and are happier
 The young ones are better behaved and do well in school
""
"It's not the same, but I had ""adopted"" grandparents growing up"
"  Basically, when my mom's father died young, her best friend's father stepped in and volunteered to be her surrogate dad"
"  He was my grandpa, his wife was my granny, his daughter (my mom's best friend) is my aunt, and her kids are my cousins"
  As far as I'm concerned they're all family
""
There is actually a program that kind of meets this need where I live
 People can sign up for a ‘rented’ grandparent
 It allows families that have no living grandparents or no or limited contact with the grandparents to have grandparents in their life
   It helps elderly people who want social contact and it helps families who want their children to experience grandparents
   How you interact with the ‘rented’ grandparents is up to you and your ‘rented’ grandparent
" So if you want to do a lot together, they match you with someone who wants to be very active"
 If you want someone more laid back they match you with a laidback person  Edit: They are called 'rental' or 'borrowed' grandparents
 You don't actually pay to spend time with them
 Should have probably clarified that

My Japanese grandfather was adopted by a childless elderly couple at the age of 27

 I visited his mother (but not his birth-age 27! Mother) as a child

" We did lots together when I was a child, cooking, art, gardening ect"
""
" ( I think she even talked me a little piano ) Then I became a stupid teenager and went through a stupid emo stage and didn't see her as often, she sadly passed away when I was 16"
 At her funeral I found out she often talked about me to her own children and actually viewed me as a grandchild
 She was amazing and I am very grateful for her she was always super nice and kind
 I miss her dearly

"  The suggestion in this thread is at least about something more important than just the week's news, so why not do it?"
"Personally, I would prefer a debate in which the candidates are given a subject, 3-5 minutes to go over their plan, and use facts, data, charts, and other tools to prove their point"

" They even took a picture of him and posted it in the window saying ""Do Not Serve This Man""  TL;DR  Salty dude without reservation steals reservation book and then tries to come back later  EDIT: If anyone wants to use this for a sitcom feel free; just let me reprise my role as the waiter and we can call it even"

" One Valentine’s Day I was working the night shift, and this woman comes down with a cut above her eye looking like she just went a few rounds in the ring with a boxer"
 Woman starts sobbing and asks us to call the coos which we do immediately
" Turns out this girl’s boyfriend just beat the shit out of her during a fight, and from what I could tell this probably wasn’t the first time"
"   So after the cops show up and haul the dude off, my manager offers her a different room on comp as we need to leave the guy’s stuff where it is for him to pick up the next day"
" She accepts, and I go up with the woman to help her collect her stuff and move to the new room"
" There were a bunch of bottles of alcohol in the room, and she donated them to the front desk staff"
" I got a bottle of Hypnotiq, and some vodka"
 Manager got a bottle of Patron
"  Cherry on top of everything, the dude’s wife called later that night saying someone had stolen his card as he was out of town on a business trip"
" Never one to defend an abuser, I told her where she could find her husband"

I was a delivery driver for a fruit bouquet company and I had two arrangements from the same guy
   Routes were made for me and the truck was loaded so there was no way I could mess this up
 Delivered both arrangements to the appropriate address
  I headed back to the store to find the store owner and the guy who sent these in an argument
 This idiot put the wrong name to the houses
 And it was on the card with the arrangement
 Along with the phone numbers
 So both women called each other and then called the guy
 He tried to say it was my fault
 Then the person who took the order
 He ordered it ONLINE
 All we did was import the order
   I hate valentine's day because of that place but man was that great

Chris Rock is performing a standup gig tonight in Boston—his first appearance since the Oscars
" If you were Chris, what would be the first joke you’d tell, assuming you’d want to acknowledge Will Smith’s slap?"
""
"Walk out, wait for applause to die down, then:  “Don’t get any ideas, none of you motherfuckers are famous"
”
“Apparently Will’s relationship is open to anything but jokes”
"Maybe just a list of the comebacks that went through his head, but were withheld at the time?   Like my favorite one, ""Don't worry, this is the Oscars"
  You don't have to worry about anyone up on this stage saying your wife's name
""""
"“he really deserved the award for best actor, because after watching the movie Ali, I thought he actually knew how to throw a punch"
”
You know how you can tell that slap wasn't staged?  Will didn't make the studio give Jaden a role

To get started are there any insecure couples in the front row?

I was at the Comedy Cellar which based on the timing must have been one of the first times Michelle Wolf performed after the White House correspondents dinner
" She said something like “I’m Michelle, and I never thought I’d say this but you probably know me from Fox News"

Some one said he should get a helmet and a neck support
 I think this would’ve been the first part of the joke and than he should’ve said : I brought this because my next joke is about Shaquille O’Neals wife

"Redditors who work at remote places like forest officers, oil rig workers, etc, what creepy things have you noticed while at work?"
""
I worked at a public forest
 One day we had someone report a dead animal on the side of one of our trails
 A few of us from the front desk hiked out to see what it was
 It looked like a giant peice of
""
""
liver maybe? Just a pile of smooth red meat
""
""
no blood around
" And it was wrapped up in a t shirt, with some coins scattered around it"
" We called our rangers to go check it out, and one of them was pretty sure it was a placenta"
" The weird part is, you have to check in thru a front desk"
 So someone either snuck a placenta/liver in or gave live birth/removed an organ on our trails
" We never got an answer on what the pile of meat was, how it got there, or why"

I do a lot of stream work so I spend time out in pretty rural areas walking streams and rivers
" Once my coworker and I were working in a more urban environment and came across what we initially thought was a body - which of course triggered ""Oh shit!!"" from us - but it ended up being a firefighter's dummy that had fallen down a hill"
 We felt pretty dumb
"  Other notable things include a small grave in the middle of nowhere for someone's dog (pretty sad), and a stuffed rabbit with shotgun shells placed where its eyes should be, a mannequin very purposely placed in a chair in the middle of the woods, and lots of little random alters"
  I also did work in Myrtle Beach (what a hell hole) and accidentally walked into an inhabited homeless camp
 I was peering into a stormwater grate when I looked up and saw a homeless person standing in his shelter staring at us and saying nothing
 I felt like I was trespassing so we quietly left

I used to work in a ship and we're usually gone 3 to 10 months at a time
 I worked night shift so this meant I would sleep in the sleeping quarters during day time with either just me or a handfull of other crew members where usually there'd be 20 to 30 of us in there
 It wasn't so bad
 Actually I really liked because it's a lot more peaceful sleelimg during the day
 You don't hear anybody else snoring or someones footsteps because they have to piss or something like that
 All you can hear is the light creak of the walls and the floors of the ship and all you can feel is the sway of it on the ocean
 A bit haunting and creepy of you really think about it but I like it
   All that ended when there was a short period of time was literally only 2 of us in there or at least that's what I thought
 I started hearing light taps across the room
 At  first they were light taps
 Then it would get a bit faster
 Sometimes it'll get a bit louder
 I'd ignore it if it wasn't so utterly annoying
 I look at where the other guys is sleeping and he seems to be fast asleep accompanied by his light snoring
" 2nd day, there it goes again"
 I tried to follow the sound but for some reason it bounced around the room like an echo
 Eventually it comes to an abrupt halt
 So I try to sleep it off
 During work at night I tried to ask my mate about it but he said he was too tired to even notice
 I guess I'm alone on this pursuit
   3rd day I take my pursuit one step futher by not sleeping right away
 I'd be fully awake when it starts so I'll have a better chance of discovering the source
 There it goes again
" This time I go from one empty rack to the next until finally it was loud as fuck, tapping in progress"
 My heart was thumping like a jackhammer
 I pulled the curtain to the side
 There laid the biggest dude I've ever seen on the ship holding his dick mid stroke
" You have no idea the speech I prepared for this guy, in my head, for keeping me up for several days but at that exact moment I had no idea what to say"
 Of course I gave out a small yalp which didn't help the situation
 I never thought I'd be locking eyes with another dude while he's gripping his dong when I began this honorable pursuit
   With the current situation I mustered my best attempt at displaying my annoyance
" It somehow came out as an apology followed by ""I keep hearing tapping noises"""
" He hadn't said anything yet but at that exact moment, I realized that his elbow that which belong to the fapping arm is resting right on the wall probably banging on it over and over and over"
 I didn't wait for a reply
" I nodded my head, kind of rolled my eye and walked away"
 It will never be easy trying to avoid a big guy like him everyday  in the same sleeping quarters

I work on North sea oil rigs on an ad-hoc basis (off the coast of Scotland) 
  Wouldn't say anything was particularly paranormal creepy but it can be very unsettling/weird place
   Fog can come rolling in out of nowhere and other rigs you can see off the sides can disappear in front of your eyes
" Sometimes you can't see the walkways 6ft in front of you or if you're walking over grating you can't see the sea below your feet (about 60m down from feck to sea) but you can hear it, all be it muffled"
 The fog can roll in over the course of a few minutes too so a perfectly clear day becomes pea soup
  You can also feel the rig moving/swaying on high winds /rough seas
 Even though it's a fixed leg Platform
 Very unnerving to feel your office swaying when it shouldn't be
  My last trip was my first ever Nightshift and I found it particularly unsettling as you've got the background noise of the plant but I walked around the whole rig without seeing another living soul for the whole shift (usually there are about 130 people on board although smaller rigs have smaller headcounts) 
   Usually once a trip im hit by this awareness that you are just very isolated and in the middle of no where (most rigs I've worked on are an hour's chopper ride from land)
 So if things go wrong it can escalate very quickly

"During college that was located away from major cities, the woods were all around us"
" That being said, there was a highly rated trail, the Loyalsock Trail, which was about an hour drive from the university"
 I invited a friend to come with me as he had never been on an extended backpacking trip
 A 50+ mile trail that we intended to backpack over the four day weekend
 I am an Eagle Scout who has spent countless hours in the woods and went on backpacking trips consistently throughout my college experience
" As many have said before me, you get used to the minor “spooky” things happening; Coyote howls, raccoons in the middle of the night, even the occasional unknown noise"
" The scariest thing to find in the woods, however, are people"
"  We were about 20 miles into the trail and, being Pennsylvania where the underbrush and trees line the trails pretty densely, I always walk about 100 meters off of the trail to reduce the chances of me disturbing people/people disturbing me (especially in the early morning when I choose to sleep in)"
" Following that same strategy, my friend and I go out of our way to be in this amazing spot a good ways off of the trail where it would even be difficult to see our flashlights from the trail"
" This spot was on a peninsula where a creek met a river, meaning there was only one way into our camp and only one way out"
" We start a fire, cook our food, and drink some (but not enough to get either of us drunk)"
 We put the fire out about midnight and head in to our individual tents
 All is quite
" It is the fall semester, so leaves are on the ground, the moon is brightly shining through the bare trees, and the air is cool"
 The only noise is the occasional time when I would hear my friend turn over in his sleep
" Then, I hear the voices"
""
""
  The voices sounded very close for being on the trail 100+ meters away
 I check my watch; 3am
 Who hikes at 3am? We are 20 miles in
" I slowly get out of my sleeping bag, slowly unzip my tent, only to see my friend peaking out of his tent in the exact same fashion"
" He quickly moves his finger over his mouth in an exaggerated “hush” signal, then used the same hand to frantically motion towards the way of the trail"
 Then we see them
" Four adults, three men and one woman, walking directly towards our camp"
 No lights illuminating their path; They are walking silently at this point
 Only one of them has a backpack; An impossibility for the long hike they were 1/3 of the way through
" Being a long trip, you bring wood cutting supplies to chop branches into smaller branches to burn; For me, this was a survival knife"
" Grabbing the knife, believing it is my only way of defending myself, I am more disheveled than I ever have been, especially knowing that a knife is barely defense at all"
" These people walk into our site, sit down by our extinguished fire pit, and just sit there for what felt like an eternity"
   My friend speaks up and asks what they are doing in our campsite
" Without answering the question, they ask if we have any food"
 Having packed as lightly as possible for the long trip
" We had only a few extra Mountain House, MRE-style meals"
 I grab one out of my bag and toss it to one of the men
" In rapid succession, I ask why they aren’t using a light, if they need help finding the trail, and why they are hiking so late"
" They respond with the following:  1) “We don’t use lights” 2) “We know where the trail is” 3) “It is better to hike late at night”  Unnerved at this point, my friend asks them to leave"
 They respond by asking if we want to light the fire and hangout for a bit
 No we do not
" They grab their bag, get up, and leave without speaking another word"
 We watch them leave and take shifts making sure that they didn’t come back
" Needless to say, we both got very little sleep that night"
" When the sun rose the next morning, we finally got “real” sleep"
" By the afternoon, when we woke up, it all felt like a weird dream of sorts"
 The only evidence was a fuzzy cap that they must have dropped that I have to this day
  I have never had something as weird/spooky as that happen in the woods and hope to never have it happen again
" In the eight years since that trip, I haven’t been back to the Loyalsock Trail"

"On our drill ship that was built in China, we noticed on the drawings there was a room"
 We went to look at it and couldnt find an entrance but the spacing was obvious there was an extra room
" It might not sound so creepy unless youve been in these shipyards where two things are known to happen: stowaways, although i doubt it in this case, but also hundreds of workers at any given time following orders blindly"
" So we confirmed that the room had all six sides, yet not a single weld on the outside"
 There is only one way this couldve happened and im sure youre starting to get it now
 They must have welded from the inside for this room and then realized they had no way out upon completion if the gasses didnt kill them first
   Its extremely heavy around that room
 People say they hear things
 I have definitely
 This isnt some old ship either
 I rode this ship from China to Amsterdam after completion and then the maiden voyage to America
 I guess it happens quick
I’m a little late to this thread but I hope this doesn’t get buried because this story still haunts me
"  I worked as the county historic preservationist in southern Appalachia, working on the buildings and properties the county owned"
 One of the “benefits” included with my job was living on-site at one of the historic properties
 The historic house was an imposing brick mansion built in the 1810s and I lived in a small caretakers house about 20 feet away
" This was in the backwoods, so to deter trespassing and vandalism the county had built an 8 foot tall fence around the entire 5 acre parcel and put barbed wire on top of the fence"
" I mention this all just to show it was basically impossible for anyone, or anything, to jump or climb over the fencing and onto the property"
"   One night, after working late at another property, I pulled up to my entrance gate, let myself in, locked it behind me and then drove the 100 yards down the gravel road to my house"
 There were no lights on the property so I could only see by my headlights
"   As I turned my car around the corner of one of the outbuildings and parked it, my lights shown on a thing that I still have a hard time describing effectively"
" It was the size of a deer, but with long spindly legs and long shaggy hair"
" Almost like a taller Maned Wolf, if you’ve ever seen pictures of one of those"
" That alone shook me as there was no way something of that size should’ve been able to get through, or over my fencing"
"   What follows is absolutely true: I got out of my car to get a better look at what the hell the thing was and as I opened the door and got out, the thing took off running away: not on four legs, but on two! I literally watched this thing raise it’s back up, stand at full height on its back legs and sprint away"
"   I absolutely freaked out at that point, grabbed my maglight and my shotgun from inside and tried to find the thing again"
 There was no trace
 No tracks or anything; I have no idea how it got in OR out of my property
"   I didn’t sleep at all that night, just sat on my couch with my shotgun watching my front door, hoping that whatever I saw didn’t come back and burst in"
 I cannot explain what the hell I saw that night but it still raises the hair on my neck every time I think about it

"When I was a kid living in Queensland, Australia I used to ""bush bash"" meaning, walk off the beaten track through thick scrub"
 I knew the national park my house backed onto like the back of my hand
 I knew from the topography where I was at all times
" Both my parents were ex-military and had a sort of ""hands off"
""" Trusting me even as young as 12 to venture off on my own into the wilderness"
"  So I could just pack a lunch, and my sister and neighborhood friend would come with, we'd head off early in the morning, returning just before sunset usually"
"  Once, when I, the oldest, was about 14, we had been following creek beds and bashing over heavily forested hills towards an area I'd never been"
"   We came down a hill, through a gully full of ferns and followed a dry creekbed for another hour, the sides of the creek became steep and rocky, before long we were passing through a gorge"
"  As we emerged from the gorge, we noticed what looked like a dwelling"
 Being idiot kids we wanted to see what was up
 It looked abandoned at first
 But as we got closer we saw that tarps had been affixed to the ramshackle structure
 Chicken-wire surrounded what looked like a pen just outside
"   As my eyes traveled across it, I suddenly caught another pair of eyes looking directly back at me"
 A rottweiler
" We started slowly edging back away from the property, but it was too late"
" The dog started going nuts and, worried that it was coming after us, or at least alerting the person/s living in the hut, we bolted"
"  I went back to the area a few times, but not too close to the abode itself and found discarded bones from small game and other bits and pieces, spent "
22 casings and such
"   As an adult and knowing the area, it's very likely we stumbled across either a homeless person camping out"
 Or a meth lab
" As the area, as I would find out as an adult, was absolutely riddled with meth labs"

I work for a power company restoring power after a storm
 Was working when a lady came up complaining that her power went out
 We explained to her thats why we were there and she should have power back soon
" She said, ""oh good, my son went down in the basement and now I can't find him"""
 I went with her with a flashlight down the road to a run down house that was partially caved in
 She walked inside and I went to follow
 As soon as I walked into the door she disappeared from my sight and I called for her multiple times
 No one responded so I ran back to our work truck to call for help
 A man that was living on her street called to me asking whats wrong and I told him the situation
 He looked at me with a cold stare and said a mom and her son died in that house 4 years ago
 I'm still shook to this day

Used to be a supervisor for a janitorial company and a couple times a week I had to go to a middle school and clean their hallway floors and gymnasium with a zamboni type vehicle that mopped and scrubbed the floor
 When I was there I had the whole school to myself
 Used to get finished quickly and go to the library and read while eating my dinner
" Well, one morning after being there, I get a call from school security and they want me to come in"
 When I get there I see a police car too
" Uh oh, I think"
" They ask me a few questions like “did you notice anything out of the ordinary or strange while you were here last night?” No, I hadn’t (usually have headphones in)"
 Security then shows me camera footage of someone breaking into one of the classrooms WHILE I WAS RIDING THE ZAMBONI not far away
 I was there for another two hours
 Nothing was stolen
" But the worst part was they didn’t have footage of the person leaving, they didn’t go out the way they came in, and police had to sweep the entire school"
 Never did find out what happened with that one
